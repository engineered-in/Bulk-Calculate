## Overview

**Bulk-Calculate** is an Excel utility designed to streamline **repetitive**, **template**-based engineering calculations. By centralizing inputs and outputs into a **single summary table**, it helps engineers focus on their work instead of managing countless files. Ideal for civil, mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineers, Bulk-Calculate makes engineering projects more **data-driven** and **efficient**.

## The Problem: Pain Points in Engineering Calculations

Many engineering disciplines rely heavily on standardized templates for calculations‚Äîlike connection design in structural engineering or equipment sizing in mechanical engineering. Typically, these calculations are done in a validated Excel file used **repeatedly** for different projects, with project-specific information (like client name, logo) adjusted as needed.

However, the conventional approach of creating separate Excel files for each calculation leads to several issues:

&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **File Multiplication** - Engineers end up with dozens or hundreds of similar files, making updates and management tedious.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Data Entry Errors** - Copying data across multiple files increases the risk of errors, compromising calculation accuracy.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Manual Updates** - Changes to a template need to be repeated manually across every instance, which is time-consuming.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Inefficient Data Summarization** - Summarizing results from multiple files often requires opening and processing each file individually.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Scattered Data** - Data is dispersed across multiple files, making it hard to track calculations and find past work.   

These issues lead to wasted time, increased potential for mistakes, excessive time and effort spent on **data entry** instead of **engineering innovation**, and make it difficult to see the bigger picture across projects.

For example, imagine needing to verify if a similar design was performed in another project. In the traditional approach, you would have to manually open and search through numerous Excel files scattered across your system. Each file might have different naming conventions or be stored in different folders, making it time-consuming and frustrating to locate the relevant information, which may have even been created by a colleague who has since left the company. This inefficient process not only wastes valuable engineering hours but also risks missing critical design insights due to the sheer volume of files to manage.

### The Solution: How Bulk-Calculate Helps

**Bulk-Calculate** addresses these challenges by creating a centralized data-driven workflow: a single summary table, with each row representing a calculation file,

&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ **Single Source of Truth** - All calculation data is recorded in a single summary table, providing a clear overview.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ **Minimized File Handling** - No more handling multiple calculation files‚Äîinputs and outputs are updated directly in the summary.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ **Efficient Bulk Operations** - Perform calculations for multiple entries in one go, saving time and reducing human error.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ **Data Visibility** - Easily review, compare, and reuse calculations across different projects.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ **Bulk Export and Import** - Export results into separate files or PDFs, or import existing calculations into the summary table‚Äîall without sacrificing the familiar Excel environment.   

By **consolidating data** and reducing file clutter, Bulk-Calculate helps engineers focus on **engineering work**, rather than file management.

## Key Features

### 5. Bulk Import

- Place all workbooks in a single folder.
- Select the "Input/Output Folder" icon in the Bulk-Calculate ribbon.
- Choose the folder containing the workbooks.
- Click "Import Data" to populate the "Summary" sheet.

> **Note**: Bulk Import works only if all workbooks follow the same template structure, meaning they **must comply** with the **specified data mapping**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details><summary>Is Bulk-Calculate free?</summary>

Yes, Bulk-Calculate is completely free and open-source. You can use, view the code, and even modify it to suit your needs without any cost (except for the Microsoft Excel license ofcourse).
</details>

<details><summary>Why should I trust Bulk-Calculate?</summary>

Bulk-Calculate relies on macros, which are disabled by default in Excel unless you trust the file or its publisher. As an open-source project, the VBA code is fully transparent, allowing anyone to review it for vulnerabilities. Only verified maintainers (using GPG keys) can update the source code and release new versions.
</details>

<details><summary>Is it valuable even though it's free?</summary>

Absolutely! The goal of Bulk-Calculate is **collective progress**, not profit. Pricing it based on its value would make it inaccessible to many. Think of it like air‚Äîfree, but invaluable.
</details>

<details><summary>Do I need to know VBA or coding to use Bulk-Calculate?</summary>

No coding or VBA knowledge is required. Bulk-Calculate has a user-friendly interface that allows you to map input and output cells using the Map Data Wizard and perform bulk calculations with just a few clicks.
</details>

<details><summary>Can I use my own Excel file with Bulk-Calculate?</summary>

Yes, you can use any standalone Excel file (without external references) as a template in Bulk-Calculate. Simply map your input and output cells using the Map Data Wizard.
</details>

<details><summary>What happens if my Excel template changes?</summary>

If your template changes, you can easily update the mappings by re-running the Map Data Wizard. Bulk-Calculate will adapt to the new structure and ensure all calculations are performed correctly.
</details>

<details><summary>Can Bulk-Calculate handle large datasets?</summary>

Yes, Bulk-Calculate processes data sequentially, one datapoint at a time. While it can handle large datasets, calculations and exports may take a bit longer for larger volumes of data.
</details>

<details><summary>Can Bulk-Calculate import data from files with different structures?</summary>

No, Bulk-Calculate requires that all files used for bulk import have the same structure. The input and output cells need to be mapped consistently across all files for successful data import.
