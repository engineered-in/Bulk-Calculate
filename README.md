## What is Bulk Calculate?

**Bulk-Calculate** is a tool designed to streamline repetitive, **template**-based engineering calculations by centralizing inputs and outputs in a single summary table. 

Ideal solution for organizations transitioning to a **data-driven workflow** using Excel.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

In many engineering projects, template-driven calculations are routine, such as the design of structural elements like beams. 
Typically, these calculations are done using a standard, validated Excel file (referred to as a "**Template**") that is **reused** for **multiple calculations** across projects.
While the calculation process remains consistent across different projects, only project-specific details (e.g., client name, logo) change.


However, the conventional approach of creating separate Excel files for each calculation leads to several issues:

&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **File Multiplication** - Managing multiple similar files and updating each one manually is a time drain.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Data Accuracy Risks** - Errors can easily occur when manually entering or pasting data across multiple similar looking files.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Data Entry Overload** - Excessive time and effort is spent on data entry instead of engineering innovation.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Inefficient Data Extraction** - Summarizing results requires manually opening and extracting data from each file one-by-one.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Time-consuming Updates** - Any changes to the template must be applied manually to every file.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Losing Sight of the Big Picture** - The scattered nature of data across files makes it difficult to see the overall picture.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå **Lack of Data Visibility** - There's no centralized view of all the calculations, making it difficult to track or reference past work.  
  

For example, if I need to check if a similar beam design was performed in another project, I must search through numerous files, which is difficult and inefficient.

### How Does It Solve the Problem?

A more efficient solution would be a centralized system that records all inputs and outputs from each calculation in a single summary table, with each row representing a calculation file.
This provides:

&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ Clear visibility of data  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ Easier access to past calculations  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ More efficient updates across projects  
&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ Ability to export the summary table to spreadsheets or PDFs, preserving the look of the conventional method

## How to Use?

### 1. Selecting template spreadsheet

- Open the `Bulk-Calculate.xlsb` file in Excel. A new ribbon "Bulk-Calculate" will appear.
- Click on `Select Template` button from the Bulk-Calculate ribbon (available in Map Data group)

### 2. Interactively map your template using Map Data Wizard

- Use the `Map Data Wizard` to interactively map all the input and output variables from your selected Template File

### 3. Generate Summary Table

- Go to the "Summary" sheet.
- Click `Generate Summary Table` in the Bulk-Calculate ribbon. All variables defined in the "Mapper" sheet will appear as headers.

### 4. Fill the Summary Table with your Inputs

- Copy and paste all the input variable information into the respective columns in the "Summary" sheet.

### 5. Bulk Calculate

- Click on the `Calculate All` button to perform bulk calculation on all the records of the Summary Table

### 6. Bulk Export

- Select the `Input/Output Folder` icon in the Bulk-Calculate ribbon.
- Choose a folder where you want the files to be saved.
- Choose the file format (e.g., pdf, xlsx) in the "Export" dropdown.
- Click the `Export All` button in the Bulk-Calculate ribbon to bulk export the files.
- The files will be available in the selected folder.

### 7. Bulk Import

- Place all workbooks in a single folder.
- Select the "Input/Output Folder" icon in the Bulk-Calculate ribbon.
- Choose the folder containing the workbooks.
- Click "Import Data" in the Bulk-Calculate ribbon to populate the "Summary" sheet with data from the workbooks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details><summary>Is Bulk-Calculate free?</summary>

Yes, Bulk-Calculate is completely free and open-source. You can use, view the code, and even modify it to suit your needs without any cost (except for the Microsoft Excel license ofcourse).
</details>

<details><summary>Why should I trust Bulk-Calculate?</summary>

Bulk-Calculate relies on macros, which are disabled by default in Excel unless you trust the file or its publisher. As an open-source project, the VBA code is fully transparent, allowing anyone to review it for vulnerabilities. Only verified maintainers (using GPG keys) can update the source code and release new versions.
</details>

<details><summary>Is it valuable even though it's free?</summary>

Absolutely! The goal of Bulk-Calculate is **collective progress**, not profit. Pricing it based on its value would make it inaccessible to many. Think of it like air‚Äîfree, but invaluable.
</details>

<details><summary>Do I need to know VBA or coding to use Bulk-Calculate?</summary>

No coding or VBA knowledge is required. Bulk-Calculate has a user-friendly interface that allows you to map input and output cells using the Map Data Wizard and perform bulk calculations with just a few clicks.
</details>

<details><summary>Can I use my own Excel file with Bulk-Calculate?</summary>

Yes, you can use any standalone Excel file (without external references) as a template in Bulk-Calculate. Simply map your input and output cells using the Map Data Wizard.
</details>

<details><summary>What happens if my Excel template changes?</summary>

If your template changes, you can easily update the mappings by re-running the Map Data Wizard. Bulk-Calculate will adapt to the new structure and ensure all calculations are performed correctly.
</details>

<details><summary>Can Bulk-Calculate handle large datasets?</summary>

Yes, Bulk-Calculate processes data sequentially, one datapoint at a time. While it can handle large datasets, calculations and exports may take a bit longer for larger volumes of data.
</details>

<details><summary>Can Bulk-Calculate import data from files with different structures?</summary>

No, Bulk-Calculate requires that all files used for bulk import have the same structure. The input and output cells need to be mapped consistently across all files for successful data import.
</details>

<details><summary>Does Bulk-Calculate work with older versions of Excel?</summary>

Bulk-Calculate is compatible with Excel 2013 and later. However, for the best experience and performance, it's recommended to use the latest version of Excel.
</details>

<details><summary>Can I use Bulk-Calculate for non-engineering projects?</summary>

Yes! While Bulk-Calculate is designed for engineering calculations, it can be applied to any repetitive data-driven task. As long as you can map the input and output cells, it will work for your needs, whether in finance, research, or other fields.
</details>
